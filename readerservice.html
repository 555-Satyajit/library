The documents constitute Dictionaries (Language and Subject), Directories, Bibliographies, Handbooks, Yearbooks, Manuals, Encyclopedias, Guidebooks, maps, atlases, Multi volume sets published by National and International agencies. The Library holds a comprehensive collection of reference materials for the benefit of the reading public of Odisha as other small public Libraries functioning in different localities of the State are not viable enough to procure these materials.</p>

                            <h4 class="collection-title">Area Studies Collection</h4>
                            <p>A classification Schedule for Area Studies has been devised by Prof. D.R.Kalia to help classifying documents under Area Studies collection. The Area number of a specific place, country or region chosen from the schedule is only superimposed over the class number of the documents concerned so that all documents dealing with that place, country or region are brought together under the specific Area Number and form Area Study Collection.</p>
                            <p>To facilitate researcher doing research on different aspects of Odisha (that is on socio-economic and cultural aspects, political situation and conditions, scientific and technological developments, History and geography etc), the Reference and Research Section of HKM state Library stocks and organizes all such documents published so far on the State (i.e. on Odisha) together under Area studies collection. For comparative study and supplementary reading it also gathers materials on those aspects of other areas of the country as well as the world. These collections are named as Odisha Collection, National Collection and International Collection.</p>
                            <p>In recent times one can feel the importance of Area studies. People are travelling too much for recreation, business, and education and for jobs due to globalization. To know about that locality they are asking for books of that particular region instead of subject. So it is immensely helpful to them.</p>

                            <p>To avoid the complications arising from determining a Biographee's most association with a particular subject under which it could be gathered, the library follows the optional provision made in DDC 20 under 920 Biography that to class biography under the alphabet 'B' or 920 undivided. The classifiers mostly get confused in grouping biographies of the persons those are associated with humanities, social sciences and history, as most of them equally contribute to number of subjects and create confusion in determining the particular subject to which he or she is prominently associated.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, to overcome such situation the library gathers biographies at one place under Class Number 'B' divided in to three divisions called National Biography, International Biography and Odisha Biography. The persons of National and International importance are gathered in their respective section where as biographies concerned to the state of Odisha are grouped under Odisha Biography. Further to subdivide Autobiography, Individual Biography and Collective Biography, the library adopts an innovative device i.e. BA-Autobiography, BI-Individual Biography and BC-Collective Biography.</p>
